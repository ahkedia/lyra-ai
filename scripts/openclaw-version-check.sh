# openclaw-version-check.sh — Weekly openclaw version check, auto-upgrade, and Lyra improvements report
#
# Schedule: Sundays at 9am UTC (via crontab)
# What it does:
#   1. Checks npm for latest openclaw version
#   2. If newer than installed: upgrades, restarts gateway, sends Telegram summary
#   3. Always sends a weekly "openclaw status" ping with release notes link
#   4. Runs a Sonnet agent to synthesize how new capabilities could improve Lyra
#
# Uses: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN from /root/.openclaw/.env

Go to https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases and find what changed between these versions. Use curl + Tavily if needed to fetch release notes.

Then produce a short analysis (max 300 words) for Akash:
1. What are the 2-3 most significant new features or fixes in $UPGRADED_VERSION?
2. How could each one specifically improve Lyra (e.g., better memory, new model support, stability)?
3. What's the one thing Akash should actually do this week to take advantage of it?

Format as a clean Telegram message. Send it via Telegram to chat ID 7057922182."
